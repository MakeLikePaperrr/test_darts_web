[ ] Secure a postdoc position

Yes... I finally submitted the final version of my Ph.D. dissertation today: [Seismic-Wave Propagation and Ground Motion Prediction During Strong Earthquakes - The Dead Sea Transform](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299134542_Seismic-Wave_Propagation_and_Ground_Motion_Prediction_During_Strong_Earthquakes_-_The_Dead_Sea_Transform)

**I still need to defend and graduate but it seems like the end of an era is inevitable.** I enjoyed my time as a doctoral student very much. I was very fortunate to gain some serious skills in addition to the usual scientific research skill one might expect to gain during their Ph.D. I got to build a computational high performance cluster on which I computed my earthquake ground motion simulations. I got to deploy temporary seismic arrays in order to collect data in populated sedimentary basins. Although this data was not directly used in my Ph.D., I anticipate that I will use it down the road as it is a really nice dataset of continuous recordings. I got to TA several courses in geology, geophysics, geomechanics, and more at the undergraduate level, teach a full course on the *Dynamical Earth* to first year geology students while my advisor [Prof. Michael Tsesarsky](http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/engn/struct/Pages/staff/MichaelTsesarsky.aspx) was on sabbatical, and I was actively advising M.Sc. students in our group on a professional level. Perhaps I will have separate blog posts on those later on.

I have not secured a *real* postdoc position yet... This is no easy task when you come from a fairly unknown university and academic advisors who are not very well connected in the field of interest. Don't get me wrong, I think my advisors ([Prof. Michael Tsesarsky](http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/engn/struct/Pages/staff/MichaelTsesarsky.aspx) and [Prof. Zohar Gvirtzman](http://www.gsi.gov.il/eng/?CategoryID=28&ArticleID=505)) were absolutely fantastic, **really**, but neither of them comes from a seismology background and simply don't have the right connections. They made up for this in many other ways. I attended as many conferences and workshops as I wanted. This helped me make some connections myself. I met with a lot of good scientists and gave a ton of seminars all over. For a while had a good feeling but there were funding issues.

For now, I am heading for a short, in-between, postdoc at the Geological Survey of Israel (GSI) to work on underground tunnel detection. I have confident this will be meaningful work but probably not publishable (for obvious reasons...) and that is less than ideal at this point.
