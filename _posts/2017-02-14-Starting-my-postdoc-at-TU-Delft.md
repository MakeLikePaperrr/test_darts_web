I am starting my Postdoc Researcher position at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-engineering/sections/applied-geophysics-petrophysics/) today. My research is within the scope of [Prof. LÃ¤slo Evers'](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/geoscience-engineering/sections/applied-geophysics-petrophysics/staff/academic-staff/prof-dr-lg-laeslo-evers/) VIDI grant from NWO and aims to look at seismo-acoustic coupling. We are going to use signals from ground truth events (earthquakes, explosions, volcanic eruptions, landslides, etc.) in order to investigate the seismic and infrasonic components of the wave-field generated by these sources.

At this point, it all sounds very crazy to me. Think about it: We are going to look at signals that have propagated through the solid earth, generated a perturbation at the ground-air interface that was significant enough to move a large volume of air, this perturbation has traveled 50 km up into the stratosphere (or even 80 plus km into the thermosphere) and returned back down to a seismo-acoustic array on the ground at a distance of many hundreds of km away from the source.

*Wish me luck!*
